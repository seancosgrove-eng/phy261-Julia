    "This is an exercise to give you a start using the command line in a Linux terminal. I fully expect that you will have to look up some commands at [this link](https://cheatography.com/davechild/cheat-sheets/linux-command-line/).  By the end of the course you’ll understand how to do all of this stuff, and why you’d care to.\n",

    "New you may well ask \"What does this have to do with physics?\", which is a very valid question. The answer is simple: knowledge of Linux and the command line will help you to be a more efficient scientist with a broad set of tools at your disposal. In addition, a good deal of data analysis is done on computer servers, and these invariably run on Linux. \n",
